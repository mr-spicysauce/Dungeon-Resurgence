# Dungeon Resurgence
Dungeon Resurgence Is a game made in the Godot 4.0 game engine for my collage 8.2 assignment.

I have many a handfull of games/demos in Godot 4.0 and Godot 3.5 but this is my first time diving in and making a full game for this collage assigment. A lot of work and planning has gone into this game so far and after these 2 weeks are over I will continue to make the game better and more expansive as I have already pre-coded a lot of the game before the assigment started.

I am still very new to making video games and I have been further restricted with the time limits, so I have balanced quality and jank where I see fit. I think the jankiness of the game is funny and it fits well with the low-polly theme

# "Story/Plot"

In its current stage the game does not have a lot of story or plot but the concept of this game is that you are a knight who is low on money and with nothing left to lose you spend the rest of your money on a sword and venture into the deep dark dungen on the side of the cliff. Here you fight monsters and find gold, treasures and items *but* there is no way out again. When you eventually die you will wake up outside of dungen as if it was all just a dream, but you still have all of your items and gold. Then its the regular dungen crawler/roguelike like game where you progress slowly over time.

I am not sure why you would want to edit my game files or code as it is ***horrendously*** bad but have fun looking lul
